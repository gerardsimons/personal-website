# Hello?
That quote was actually part of the default first post of this website theme, but I liked it, so I kept it. I can definitely recommend this show as a good way to pass corona time fast and rather funnily. It is probably the most realistic looking hacking themed TV show / movie I've seen. I am by no means a hacker, but just look at all those sweet Linux [terminals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGjLhOhMLXc). Right? RIGHT?! 

The cover photo is one I personally took last year on a trip to Scotland with my good friend Georgios. The animal in the picture is not George. George is much hairier. The cow doesn't really have so much to do with this post, but I feel strongly that shaggy beasts never fail to liven up a website.

Anywho, hello, and welcome all, whoever you are. Though you are most likely actually just me, constantly re-reading and fretting over potential grammar mistakes. Just like you probably, most of these days are spent inside, and I was looking for some sort of hobby, and I thought it would **finally** be a good moment to make a website, again.

# Old in Computer Years
Just like dog years, computer years go by fast - real fast. So with 10+ years experience I feel old. Looking back, HTML4, CSS and - sorry for cursing - PHP really got me into web development and excited about the web as place where you marry technology with design in a very free and personal way. Then came the JavaScript, the jQuery and now there's a new framework every year, which was all very offputting to me. I must admit thought that having learnt a little React, it was kinda fun. The last time I made a personal website, was for my small freelance business and was just a very bare HTML placeholder that said "under construction" for its entire measly existence. Before even that I am pretty sure I still used that giant [LAMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle) stack with MySQL, PHP and the likes, including paid hosting and FTP servers. Ah the good old days.

## Staying Young with Hugo

![Image](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/c38c7334cc3f23585738e40334284fddcaf03d5e/2e17c/images/hugo-logo-wide.svg)

So what do you do if you feel old? You get a hot new girlfriend! Or in the case of social distancing you just get a new webwsite. This time around though, things would be different. Static generators are here, well have been here for a while, actually. I had been oggling them for a while, but only now decided it was time. And I love it. After some setting up, all you do is write in markdown files and it turns those in HTML. You can even mix and match markdown and HTML easily. A bit of background on generators: Jekyll is extremely popular and powers GitHub pages. Hugo however, is said to be much faster and powered by Go and as we all know, Go [is so hot right now](https://youtu.be/Jhc6CRgwkqg?t=7). So having decided on that, I also choose a fancy theme to go along, called [hello, friend](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend) - thanks again [Radek](https://twitter.com/panr). To summarize: The workflow goes something like this:

* `hugo new site personal-website`
* `hugo new posts/my-post-title-here.md`
* `hugo server -D`, the `-D` flag is important because it will show the draft you are working on!
* Open [localhost:1313](localhost:1313)
* Open `my-post-title-here.md` in your favorite Markdown editor
* Save the file; at every change Hugo will detect the changes and re-render the website

{{< figure src="/img/sweet-setup.png" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="Hello Friend!" captionPosition="center" >}}

This means you can have a nice split-screen setup of your editor of choice next to your browser of choice. Here is an example of my setup: Sublime with Chrome.

And since Hugo is really geared towards developers, you get some sweet syntax highlighting for your Markdown code snippets. Let me exemplify by a code snippet of Google's PageRank algorithm in Python:

```python
import numpy as np

def pagerank(M, num_iterations=100, d=0.85):
    N = M.shape[1]
    v = np.random.rand(N, 1)
    v = v / np.linalg.norm(v, 1)
    iteration = 0
    while iteration < num_iterations:
        iteration += 1
        v = d * np.matmul(M, v) + (1 - d) / N
    return v
```


## Hosting
As for the hosting, I originally wanted to put it on Google's App Engine. From my experience at Captain AI I really started to enjoy it, and its generous free tier would make it free for any small sized personal website. That brings me to the most important point of this post:

If you are still paying for hosting your personal website, please let me stop you right there. **Paying for web hosting is definitely not needed in 2020.**

There's a couple of good free-ish options out there. I think Google Cloud Platform's App Engine would have been fine to do this, but I felt using a big cloud solution like that for a personal website to be a bit of an overkill. Also, I always wanted to try [Netlify](https://netlify.com/), which seemed like a simple and sleek cloud solution for personal projects. I especially like it's super straightforward integration with GitHub. Any code push is automatically picked up and run through Hugo. This continuous build cycle is not uncommon these days but was particularly easy to use in this case.

Also, Hugo and Netlify go very well together! It took a bit to set it all up, but now it's just down to writing Markdown files, and who doesn't love writing Markdown files? It's so ghetto!

So for hosting your website on Netlify you do:

* Register!
* Connect the GitHub repo that contains your code
* Configure netlify.toml for Hugo
* Remove the draft status for each post you want to be visible on your website
* Git commit and push!
* Check build logs
* Be amazed, or appalled by your creation

# run, gerard.run
Oh and the name gerard.run? Well, .sh was my first hope / love. It's the file extension for shell scripts, but [some Spanish bastard-o](https://gerard.sh/about) took it! Damn you, Gerardo and your sexy ass domain name! Occasionally though you also have .run files. Let's just say they are the hipster versions of .sh files so it's just that much cooler, m'kay? Also I kinda like [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/23067266).

My primary, or at least most recent driver for this website however, was that I wanted to share some of my experience programming in Python for [Captain AI](https://captainai.com/), especially with regards to multiprocessing because it seems the resources on it are limited. So you can probably expect some posts on that first, but who knows, at this point I feel quite eh well shall we say *whimsical* so this whole website could also just turn out to be another memes website. 

Stay tuned, and post a comment below!
