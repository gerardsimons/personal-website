# Hello ... ?
Ok that quote was actually the default first post of this website theme, but I liked it, so I kept it. [Big whoop, wanna fight about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30GD25un0XQ)? I can also recommend Mr. Robot as another good way to pass (corona) time fast and funnily. The cover photo is one I personally took last year on a trip to Scotland with my dear friend Georgios. The animal in the picture is not George. George is much hairier ~~LINK~~ *edit:I am not allowed by privacy laws to post a picture of his hairiness*.

Anywho, hello, and welcome all, whoever you are, probably just me, constantly re-reading it, fretting over potential grammar mistakes. These are dire corona times and I thought it would **finally** be a good moment to make a website (again). 

# Old, in computer years
Just like you have dog years, similarly I think computer time goes 10x faster. Looking back, HTML4, CSS and - sorry for cursing - PHP really got me into web development back in the day when I was just starting out at university. Then came all the gnarly JavaScript, the jQuery now there's a new framework every year, which was all very offputting to me. I think the last time I made a personal website, was for my small freelance business which was just a bare HTML. Before even that I am pretty sure I still used that whole LAMP stack with phpmyadmin and the likes, including paid hosting.

## Keep Young
This time, in 2020 style static generators are the whole new thing. You just write in markdown files and it builds those in HTML. You can even mix and match markdown and HTML easily. Jekyll is extremely popular and powers all of those tech-chique GitHub pages. Hugo however, is said to be much faster and powered by Go and as we all know, Go [is so hot right now](https://youtu.be/Jhc6CRgwkqg?t=7). I choose a fancy theme called [hello, friend](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend) - thanks again [Radek](https://twitter.com/panr).

## Hosting
As for the hosting, I originally wanted to put it on Google's App Engine. From my experience using it for Captain AI I really started to enjoy it, and it's generous free tier would make it free for any small sized personal website. That brings me to the most important point of this post: **if you are still paying for web-hosting for your personal website, stop right there, as that is definitely not necessary anymore anno 2020.**. I think App Engine would have been fine to do this, but I felt using a big cloud solution like that for a personal website would be overkill. I also always wanted to use [Netlify](https://netlify.com/), since that seemed like a simple and sleek cloud solution for personal projects. I especially like it's super easy integration with GitHub. Any code push is automatically picked up and run through Hugo. They go very well together! It took a bit to set it all up, but now it's just down to writing Markdown files, and who doesn't love writing Markdown files? It's so ghetto!


# Gerard.run
Oh and the name gerard.run? Well, .sh was my first love (extensions for shell scripts), but some Spanish bastard-o took it! Damn you, Spanish Gerard and your gorgeous domain name! Let's just say .run files are the hipster versions of .sh files so it's just that much cooler, m'kay? Also I kinda like [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/23067266).

    
My primary or at least most recent driver for this website was that I wanted to share some of my experience programming in Python, especially with regards to multiprocessing because it seems the resources on it are quite scarce. So you can expect some posts on that first, but who knows, at this point I feel quite eh well shall we say *whimsical*? So who knows what it shall bring us. It could also just be a post filled with meme references / YouTube links.
